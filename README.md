# Bookmarklets-for-school
A collection of bookmarklets for school to have fun with. I only made a few of these, so FULL CREDIT OT THE OWNERS.
These epic bookmarklets will make you the cool kid at school. :)
To make a bookmarklet, simply right click on your bookmark bar after copying the code from this repository.
There will be an "Add page" button. Click that. You will see a URL bar and a bar to name it. Name it whatever you want, then paste the code into the URL bar.
When you click the bookarklet, it will execute whatever code is there. Please be careful when executing other's code, for it may download malware(malicias software) or viruses. The Master Bookmarklet 2.0 is made my friend Gabe AND whoever created the original one. The Seterra Maps BOT was created my me and a friend. "Weird" was created by me (as it is very very very simple code). And Finally "Bypass" is by ME. If you use my code or share it please give me credit for my work. It you do not and steal my code, I WILL HUNT YOU DOWN AND LAUNCH A CYBER ATTACK ON YOU AND THEN SPAM YOUR EMAIL WITH VERY SUS THINGS.
