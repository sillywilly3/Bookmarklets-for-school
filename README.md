# Bookmarklets-for-school
A collection of bookmarklets for school to have fun with. I only made a few of these, so FULL CREDIT OT THE OWNERS.
These epic bookmarklets will make you the cool kid at school. :)
To make a bookmarklet, simply right click on your bookmark bar after copying the code from this repository.
There will be an "Add page" button. Click that. You will see a URL bar and a bar to name it. Name it whatever you want, then paste the code into the URL bar.
When you click the bookarklet, it will execute whatever code is there. Please be careful when executing other's code, for it may download malware(malicias software) or viruses.
